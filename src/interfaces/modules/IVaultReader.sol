/// @title IVaultReader
/// @notice Read-only interface for querying vault state, calculations, and metrics without modifying contract state
/// @dev This interface provides comprehensive access to vault information for external integrations, front-ends, and
/// analytics without gas costs or state modifications. The interface covers several key areas: (1) Configuration:
/// Registry references, underlying assets, and fee parameters, (2) Financial Metrics: Share prices, total assets,
/// and fee calculations for accurate vault valuation, (3) Batch Information: Current and historical batch states
/// for settlement tracking, (4) Fee Calculations: Real-time fee accruals and next fee timestamps, (5) Safety Functions:
/// Validated batch ID and receiver retrieval preventing errors. This read-only approach enables efficient monitoring
/// and integration while maintaining clear separation from state-modifying operations. All calculations reflect current
/// vault state including pending fees and accrued yields, providing accurate real-time vault metrics for users and
/// integrations.
