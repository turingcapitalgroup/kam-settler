/// @title IVault
/// @notice Core interface for retail staking operations enabling kToken holders to earn yield through vault strategies
/// @dev This interface defines the primary user entry points for the KAM protocol's retail staking system. Vaults
/// implementing this interface provide a gateway for individual kToken holders to participate in yield generation
/// alongside institutional flows. The system operates on a dual-token model: (1) Users deposit kTokens (1:1 backed
/// tokens) and receive stkTokens (share tokens) that accrue yield, (2) Batch processing aggregates multiple user
/// operations for gas efficiency and fair pricing, (3) Two-phase operations (request → claim) enable optimal
/// settlement coordination with the broader protocol. Key features include: asset flow coordination with kAssetRouter
/// for virtual balance management, integration with DN vaults for yield source diversification, batch settlement
/// system for gas-efficient operations, and automated yield distribution through share price appreciation rather
/// than token rebasing. This approach maintains compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure while providing
/// transparent yield accrual for retail participants.
